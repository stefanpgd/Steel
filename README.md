# 🪨⛏️ Steel - A DirectX 12 Framework
This is my personal framework build with DirectX 12 which is used for my personal projects.
Steel gets continously iterated with each project, since I usually find the need for new systems with different projects.

### Contents:
- A basic engine loop ( Start, Update, Render )
- Framework classes like `Input` or `Mathematics`
- A simple Rendering loop, which can be replaced
- DirectX Components such as: `DXDevice`, `DXDescriptorHeap`
- Some useful components for rendering such as: `DepthBuffer`, `Texture`
- Some Utilities for Randomness and Logging
