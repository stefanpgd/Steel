# ü™®‚õèÔ∏è Steel - A DirectX 12 Framework
This is my personal framework build with DirectX 12 which is used for my personal projects.
Steel gets continously iterated with each project, since I usually find the need for new systems with different projects.

### Contents:
- A rendering framework that supports: _Rasterization, Compute pipeline and DirectX Ray Tracing_
- A simple engine loop to work with (Start, Update, Render)
- Framework classes like `Input` or `Mathematics`
- Model loading support for glTF files

### Example/Reference Project(s)
- (WIP) Tiny Hybrid, a simple setup of rasterization with Ray Traced shadows
- Hello Compute, a setup of a compute pipeline outputting UV coordinates to the screen
